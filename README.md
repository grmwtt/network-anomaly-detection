# Network Anomaly Detection System

> Status: In Development<br>
> Currently Working On: EDA

## Overview
An unsupervised machine learning system that detects network intrusions and cyber attacks by learning normal traffic patterns and flagging anomalous behavior in real-time.

## Tech Stack
- Python 3.10+
- PyTorch (Autoencoders, VAE, LSTM)
- Scikit-learn (Isolation Forest, One-Class SVM)
- Streamlit (Real-time monitoring dashboard)
- MLflow (Experiment tracking)

## Project Goals
- [ ] Data pipeline and preprocessing
- [ ] Classical anomaly detection baselines
- [ ] Deep learning models (Autoencoder, VAE, LSTM)
- [ ] Real-time monitoring dashboard
- [ ] Model evaluation and comparison
